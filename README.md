## 🌌 Overview
**Anti-Gravity** is a futuristic, state-of-the-art Deepfake and Fake News detection system. It combines specialized Neural Networks with live Global Knowledge Graph verification to distinguish between human-generated truth and AI-synthesized deception. 

Wrapped in a high-performance **Cyberpunk-themed dashboard**, it offers a window into the future of digital forensics.

## 🔥 Professional Features (v3.0)

### 🌐 1. Global Knowledge Verification
The system doesn't just guess; it **knows**. Using the **Wikipedia API**, Anti-Gravity performs a granular, segment-by-segment cross-reference of any text input against the world's largest repository of human knowledge.

### 🎥 2. Temporal Video Forensics
Beyond static images, our **Vision Forensics Lab** uses OpenCV to perform temporal sampling. It extracts 5 frames across the video's timeline, analyzing inconsistencies in metadata and neural patterns to provide a unified truth-probability score.

### 📊 3. Forensic Intelligence Logs
Transparency is key. After every scan, the **Intelligence Terminal** provides a line-by-line breakdown of the verification process, showing exactly which data segments were confirmed and which triggered neural anomalies.

### ⚡ 4. Real-time Verification Nodes
The UI simulates a live connection to global verification nodes, providing an immersive "mission control" experience while the backend crunching massive feature tensors.
